  "enhanced_context": "Based on KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) and ACR (American College of Radiology) guidelines, the patient’s eGFR of 135.1 mL/min/1.73m² indicates Stage 1 (Normal), suggesting normal renal function for contrast studies. Severe hypotension (MAP 49.3 mmHg) increases the risk of contrast-related complications. The non-emergency admission for Injury to thoracic aorta allows for standard imaging planning. Existing clinical information was deemed sufficient, and no additional search was required. The ACR Manual on Contrast Media advises caution with contrast use, recommending hydration protocols and consideration of alternative imaging modalities when renal or hemodynamic risks are elevated."

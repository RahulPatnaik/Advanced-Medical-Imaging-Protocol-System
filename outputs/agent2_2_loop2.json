    "Perform serial monitoring of renal function (creatinine, BUN) at 24-48 hours post-contrast.",
    "Continuously monitor hemodynamics during and after contrast administration, with a low threshold for vasopressor support if MAP remains below 60 mmHg."

    "The primary diagnosis of Injury to thoracic aorta mandates a protocol capable of detailed aortic assessment.",
    "Severe hypotension (MAP 49.3 mmHg) increases risk of CIN, necessitating aggressive hydration.",
    "Post-contrast renal function monitoring is crucial for early detection of AKI.",
    "Close hemodynamic monitoring is essential due to the patient's unstable blood pressure."

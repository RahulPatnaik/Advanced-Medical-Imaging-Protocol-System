    "Utilize a low-osmolar or iso-osmolar non-ionic contrast agent at a reduced volume (e.g., 80 mL).",
    "Schedule post-contrast serum creatinine and eGFR checks at 12-24 hours and 24-48 hours post-administration."

    "The primary diagnosis of 'Injury to thoracic aorta' necessitates a protocol specifically designed for thoracic aorta visualization.",

    "Minimizing contrast volume and using less nephrotoxic contrast agents are crucial for renal safety in hypotensive patients.",

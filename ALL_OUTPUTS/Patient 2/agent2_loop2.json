    "Prioritize CT Pulmonary Angiography (CT PA) given the emergency admission for chest pain, but proceed with caution due to hypotension and moderate CKD.",
    "Administer IV hydration (e.g., isotonic saline at 1 mL/kg/hr, adjusted for hypotension) 12 hours prior to and 6-12 hours post-contrast, with careful monitoring of fluid balance and blood pressure.",
    "Obtain a repeat serum creatinine with an exact timestamp prior to contrast administration to confirm current renal function.",
    "Consider an alternative imaging modality such as a Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) scan if the patient's hemodynamic status or renal function deteriorates, or if the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy is deemed unacceptably high."

  "rationale": [
    "Patient presents with symptoms concerning for pulmonary embolism, for which CT PA is the diagnostic standard.",
    "Hypotension (MAP 59 mmHg) and Stage 3a CKD (eGFR 59 mL/min/1.73m²) increase the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy and may be exacerbated by contrast agents.",
    "The elevated BUN/Cr ratio (20) and creatinine (1.7 mg/dL) suggest potential prerenal azotemia, necessitating careful management of hydration and blood pressure.",
    "A V/Q scan offers an alternative for PE diagnosis with no iodinated contrast exposure, reducing renal risk."

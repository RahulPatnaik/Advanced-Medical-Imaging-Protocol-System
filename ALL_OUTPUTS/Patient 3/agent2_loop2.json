    "Severe CKD (eGFR 22 mL/min) and hypotension (MAP 57 mmHg) significantly increase the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and hemodynamic compromise.",

    "Alternative imaging modalities like V/Q scans or bedside echocardiography can provide critical diagnostic information for suspected PE while minimizing renal and hemodynamic risks.",

    "Prioritize a focused CT Angiography of the Chest to specifically evaluate the thoracic aorta, minimizing contrast volume compared to a full torso trauma scan.",
    "Administer 500-1000 mL of isotonic intravenous fluid pre-contrast to support renal perfusion and hemodynamics given the profound hypotension (MAP 49.3 mmHg).",
    "Utilize a low-contrast volume protocol (e.g., 80 mL total) with a split-bolus technique for the CTA.",
    "Perform post-contrast serum creatinine and eGFR assessment at 24-48 hours to monitor for any contrast-induced nephropathy."
  ],
  "rationale": [
    "The primary clinical concern is injury to the thoracic aorta, making a focused CTA more appropriate than a broad trauma scan, thereby reducing contrast exposure.",
    "The patient's severe hypotension necessitates proactive measures to mitigate contrast-related risks and support hemodynamic stability.",
    "Minimizing contrast volume is crucial in hemodynamically compromised patients to reduce potential nephrotoxicity.",
    "Post-contrast renal function monitoring is essential in at-risk patients to detect early signs of kidney injury."
